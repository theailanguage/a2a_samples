# 🧠 A2A Agent Samples – Powered by Google's Agent-to-Agent Protocol

Welcome to the `a2a_samples` repository! This project contains multiple implementations of AI agents using [Google's A2A (Agent-to-Agent)](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocol.

These implementations demonstrate how to:

* Set up and run A2A-compliant servers and clients
* Use discovery endpoints and standardized task formats
* Integrate with Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit)

We plan to continuously add more versions to illustrate various approaches and frameworks.

## 📦 Version Overview

### ✅ `version_1_simple`

A beginner-friendly demo that uses Flask to create a basic A2A server agent (`TellTimeAgent`) and a client that:

* Fetches the agent card from the `/.well-known/agent.json` endpoint
* Sends a simple task to `/tasks/send`
* Receives a time-based response

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_1_simple/)

### 🚀 `version_2_adk_agent`

A more advanced version using **Google's ADK (Agent Development Kit)** to implement a fully functional Gemini-powered A2A agent.

* Integrates memory, sessions, and artifacts
* Uses ADK runners and LLM agents
* Structured with reusable components and aligned with A2A's JSON-RPC model

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_2_adk_agent/)

### 🌐 `version_3_multi_agent`

A multi-agent orchestration example demonstrating:

* Dynamic discovery of TellTimeAgent and GreetingAgent via a registry
* An OrchestratorAgent that routes user queries to the appropriate child agent
* A CLI (`cmd.py`) for seamless end-to-end testing

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_3_multi_agent/)

### 🔄 `version_4_multi_agent_mcp`

A cutting-edge integration combining Google’s A2A protocol with Anthropic’s MCP (Model Context Protocol):

* **A2A Protocol** – Agents discover each other via JSON-RPC and call one another’s skills.
* **MCP Integration** – Dynamically discover and load external MCP servers, exposing each tool as a callable function.
* **Orchestrator Agent** – A central LLM-powered router that decides whether to delegate to a child agent or invoke an MCP tool.
* **Modular & Extensible** – Simply update a registry or config to add new A2A agents or MCP servers.

### 💡 `version_4p01_with_vision_agent`

An enhanced version of `version_4_multi_agent_mcp` that adds support for a **Gemini-based VisionAgent**:

* Accepts image input via local file path or URL
* Uses Google ADK's multimodal capabilities
* Integrates cleanly into the existing A2A and MCP architecture

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_4p01_with_vision_agent/)

### 📊 `version_5_a2a_sdk`

An educational minimal setup using the official **A2A Python SDK** with LangChain + Gemini.

* One agent (`TellTimeAgent`) with time tool
* One async client
* Streaming + multi-turn + structured response support
* Ideal starting point for learning A2A SDK fundamentals

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_5_a2a_sdk/)

### 🚀 `version_6_docker_vision_agent`

A production-style deployment of a Gemini-based VisionAgent in a Docker container:

* Fully Dockerized architecture for isolated builds
* Local testing using `curl` to hit the vision agent endpoint
* One-line deployment to **Google Cloud Run**
* Supports volume-mounted images + container-path resolution

﹖→ [Explore the folder](./version_6_docker_vision_agent/)
